An executable file of RAMP can be used as an app. (Once created python or no other depending software required)

**2. RAMP_GUI_Stanalone_file :**
In this directory, users can utilize RAMP GUI by simply running the RAMP.py file independently. This method allows for standalone usage without the need for external dependencies.

**3. RAMP_GUI_graphic_depended :**
Similar to the standalone file approach, RAMP GUI can be utilized in this directory. However, it requires the RAMP.ui file to be present in the same folder. Additionally, users can modify the GUI design using the .ui file by opening it in Qt Designer.
